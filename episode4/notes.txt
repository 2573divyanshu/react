USING PROPS
- arguments to a functional component are passed as key value pairs, which aren't comma separated
- all these parameter-argument key-value pairs are wrapped in a props object and are handed over to the functional component, then inside the functional component we access these arguments one by one use props.paramName
- either we can use the method discussed above in which we use props.paramName or we can de-reference the props object 

CONFIG DRIVEN UI
- UI is driven by data
- UI layer and Data layer in sync

TASK 4 : Copying an array restaurant objects from the Swiggy API and pasting it into our codebase, using it to make multiple cards, using props, 

TASK 5 : Truncating string with ellipsis

ABOUT KEYS
- react uses keys to uniquely identify an element 
- react needs to identify elements uniquely so that it can decide what needs to be re-rendered and what need not 
- skipping keys gives a big performance hit
- indexes shouldn't be used as keys
