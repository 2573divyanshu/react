‚ö° EMMET
- is a toolkit
- it's a plugin for text editors 
- it provides shorthand expressions that expand to full fledge HTML and CSS code

‚ö° LIBRARY v/s FRAMEWORK
- FUNCTIONALITY
- A library is a collection of pre-written code that provides specific functionality that you can use in your own code
- A framework is a more comprehensive tool that provides a structure and a set of rules or conventions for building applications
- CONTROL FLOW
- we control the flow of your application
- The control flow of your application is often dictated by the framework itself. You write code following the framework's conventions.
- USAGE
- Libraries are often used to perform specific tasks or add specific features to an application. You can selectively use parts of a library based on your requirements without being tied to the entire library.
- Frameworks are used to build entire applications. They provide a skeleton or foundation for your project, and you fill in the details by writing code that fits into the framework's structure.
- EXAMPLES
- libraries: jQuery, D3.js, redux, three.js
- frameworks: angular, vue, 

‚ö° CDN LINKS
- CDN stands for content delivery networks
- It is a network of distributed servers strategically located across different geographical locations.
- The primary purpose of a CDN is to deliver content to users more efficiently by reducing latency and improving website performance.
- Advantags :
  - high availability (content is stored at multiple servers, no problem if one of them fails)
  - improved performance (content is delivered from the nearest server)
  - Global Reach (servers are located at various geographical locations)
- Disadvantages :
  - Cost (cost of CDN depends on bandwidth usage, storage and number of requests, so CDN costs can be considerable for small enterprises)
  - Cache invalidation (may require additional configuration)
  - Privacy issues (because we are sotring our data on third party CDN servers)
  - Limited control (over certains aspects of caching, security policies, edge server behavior)

‚ö° WHY IS REACT KNOWN AS REACT?
- because it reacts quickly to changes without reloading the whole page. It's built around components that "react" and update.

‚ö° REACT v/s REACT-DOM
- REACT:
- This is the core library for building user interfaces in React applications.
- It provides the logic and mechanisms for creating components, managing their state, handling events, and rendering the UI.
- REACT-DOM
- A library tailored for browser environments.
- It provides methods for rendering React components into the DOM (Document Object Model) of a web page. 
- IN SHORT:
- React is the core library for building user interfaces in React applications, while ReactDOM is a companion library that facilitates the rendering of React components in web browsers.

‚ö° REACT.PRODUCTION.JS AND REACT.DEVELOPMENT.JS
- react.development.js
- is used in development phase
- includes additional warnings, debugging features, error messages  
- larger in size
- react.production.js
- is used in production phase 
- smaller in size
- lack development specific features

‚ö° ASYNC v/s DEFER (done in javascript)
