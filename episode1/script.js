// cdn links actually contain javascript code

// facebook developers are writing the react code

// react at the end of the day is javascript

// log React and ReactDOM into the console

// react.development.js is core react
// react-dom.development.js is additional script link for browser environment (it's like a bridge between react and the brower's dom)

// creating an element is core work of react
// attaching this react element to the browser's DOM is the work of react dom

// DOM manipulation is a costly operation

// the react.crateElement that we made is just a javascript object

// the render method takes this reactelement and converts it into DOM element and inserts it into the DOM

// code is getting untidy
// solution is jsx

// react can be written without jsx
// jsx makes our work easier

// the react cdn links should come before our script
// core react should be before reactDOM

// the content before or after the root element aren't touched

// if the root contained something, then it will be replaced by the argument of the rootElem.render()

// react is a library and not a framework

// HOMEWORK
// ðŸŸ© what are cdn links?
// what is cross origin?
// ðŸŸ© what is the difference between library and framework?
